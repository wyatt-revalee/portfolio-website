            <p > I've grown up playing video games. They've been something that has brough me joy throughout all of my life. As I got older, I started working more with technology.
                Eventually, I decided to pursue a degree in computer science. About halfway through completing my degree, I realized I needed some more projects under my belt for
                potential employers to see. That's when I decided I wanted to make a game. After all, it was something I loved, and now I had the ability as well as a reason to do it.
            </br></br>

            Inspired by the many wonderful games I've had the fortune to experience, Hollow Knight and Risk of Rain foremost, I decided to start working on Prismatic Depths. The 
        game is meant to be a 2D Platformer meets Hack & Slash meets Rogue-Like. Players will progess through various waves of increasing difficulty, fighting through enemies, collecting items,
    and becoming stronger. Making use of a reactive movement system, dodging through enemy attacks and striking back fluidly, while mixing in powerful magical attacks is the aim for the combat system.</br></br>
            
            
            Currently, this project is being remade/re-renovated/reworked/ - whatever you wanna call it. <img class="blog-image" src="../Pictures/slime.png"></br>The first iteration was a playground for me to learn Unity and game design as a whole.
        As it (unsurprisingly) turns out, that way of creating a game isn't maintainable in the long run. My code was becoming spaghetti, I used some bad practices in the foundation, and 
    rewriting whole scripts, which in turn would cause other scripts to need re-written, would be a big pain. Instead, I opted for a clean slate using the assets I've made and 
the knowledge I've gained.</p>

            <p>I hope this is something I stick to, and hopefully it turns out to be a great game in the future, but most of all I hope I have a good time making it. Stay tuned for future updates :)</p>
